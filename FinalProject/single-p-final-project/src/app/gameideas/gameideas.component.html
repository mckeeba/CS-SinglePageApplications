            converge in harmonious splendor.

        <mat-card-content>
          <p>No realm is safe from the toils and troubles of division. Currently 
            there exist 3 distinct factions, each one splitting the main land into
            borders, the first and most unified faction, named protector of the sacred
            Magical Mountains The Crystees. They remain an overall peaceful culture, made
            up of various races: humans,elves,dwarves, and Livari. The Livari are a cross-breed 
            between humans and elves, these people share in the diversity of both races. The dwarves
            however are incapable of crossing between races, and so remain un-mixed. The Second faction
            The Barthonin rescides on the eastern side of Elactri, and to the right of The Cristees.
            The Barthonin are made up of one race, void. Void people's appearance are absent of any color
            other than absolute nothing, a foggy black mist surrounds these people everywhere they go.Their 
            lands are filled with dense dark forests and mystical ruins, but because many void people tend
            to only come out at night, these lands are still occupied by a variety of groups, races, and cultures.
            Finally the third faction and the most dangerous faction Chthonic-Dominon a relentless group
            filled with orcs, the undead, and Daboi. Located on the western portion of Elactri this land is 
            split from the rest by a great wall of flame, made only traversable through underground tunnels.
            The Daboi are dark elvish wizards with red glowing tattoos marking their bodies, they hate 
            the Crystees with burning passion, and wish to destroy and take their lands. So they have unified
            with the orcs and spawning the undead to destroy them...
