      <p>For those who do not know me my name is Gus. 
        I'm currently enrolled at Appalachian State University, and am entering
          into my final year studying for a Computer Science degree,and a minor in Philosophy. Some of 
          my favorite hobbies include: listening to music, playing video games, watching sports, and 
          going to the gym. I am currently 24 years old and have big goals in life, one being
          making this game, I have always had a deep passion for creating stories, and I 
          want to be able to share these ideas with the world. Computer Science is helping provide me 
          with the necessary tools and skills to do so. That being said above are some links to my Github and LinkedIn,
          where you can see my work experience and projects over the course of my
          CS career. Also I have provided a link to google drive where you can download and see my game.
           As an added bonus here is also a table with my five favorite music artists, because I believe
          that music is a great way to get to know someone!
